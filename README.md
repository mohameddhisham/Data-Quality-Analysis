"Unleashing the Power of Data Analysis: A Real-World Project"
As an RTM specialist transitioning into a data analyst role, I've always been intrigued by the potential of data analysis to transform everyday challenges. Recently, I applied my skills to a real-world project: uncovering the extent of data duplication within our purchased datasets, which totaled 11 million records🗃 . 

By leveraging Python tools and techniques, such as Pandas I was able to efficiently analyze the massive dataset and identify the patterns of duplication. This analysis revealed that the data provider we're dealing with has been consistently sending duplicate leads, often resending leads that were previously purchased. Our latest order alone contained 80% duplicates, highlighting the need for a more rigorous quality control process.

This project not only demonstrated the power of data analysis in uncovering hidden insights and informing strategic decision-making but also showcased my ability to apply data-driven approaches to real-world problems, even when dealing with large and complex datasets. My proficiency in Python, combined with my understanding of data analysis principles, allowed me to effectively tackle this challenging project 👨‍💻. 

I'm excited to continue exploring the potential of data analysis and its applications in various fields.
